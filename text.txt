a little effort followed by\nprofound laziness
Q: How do you know someone is running Arch?\nA: They will tell you.
keep rollin' rollin' rollin'
where 30 minutes old\npackages are considered\nstable
the choice of a GNU generation
Haskall++
if it ain't broke, break it
Arch is the best!\n
no wombats where harmed\nduring development
because rebooting is for adding new hardware
install once, use forever
the least worst linux distribution
have you pacman -Syu today
if it ain't broke,\nit ain't much fun either
--force now, think later!
welcome /home
read the f***ing wiki
no bugs, just tons of features
without Arch in your life\nyou cannot boot your wife!
if you can read this,\nxorg is still working
better pacman than unpacwoman
pacman -S arch-is-the-best
99% evil, 1% tacos
may the --force be with you!
welcome ~/
makepkg not war
