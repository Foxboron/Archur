a little effort followed by profound laziness
if it ain't broke, break it
Q: How do you know someone is running Arch? A: They will tell you.
keep rollin' rollin' rollin'
where 30 minutes old packages are considered stable
the choice of a GNU generation
Haskall++
if it ain't broke, break it
Arch is the best!\n
no wombats where harmed during development
because rebooting is for adding new hardware
install once, use forever
the least worst linux distribution
have you pacman -Syu today
if it ain't broke, it ain't much fun either
--force now, think later!
welcome /home
read the f***ing wiki
no bugs, just tons of features
without Arch in your life you cannot boot your wife!
if you can read this, xorg is still working
better pacman than unpacwoman
pacman -S arch-is-the-best
99% evil, 1% tacos
may the --force be with you!
welcome ~/
makepkg not war
